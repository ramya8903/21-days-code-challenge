# Loan EMI Calculator

# Input loan details
principal = float(input("Enter loan amount:"))
rate = float(input("Enter annual interest rate (%):"))
time = float(input("Enter loan time (in years):"))

# Convert annual rate to monthly rate
monthly_rate = rate / (12*100)

# Convert years to months
months = time*12

# EMI formula
emi = (principal *monthly_rate *(1 + monthly_rate) ** months) / ((1 + monthly_rate) ** months -1)

# Output
print("Monthly EMI =",round(emi, 2))


output:
Enter loan amount: 100000
Enter annual interest rate (%): 10
Enter loan time (in years): 2
Monthly EMI = 4614.49
